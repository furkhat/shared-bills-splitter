## Motivation
So I was on a trip with my friends. And we had buch of shared bills, like when we go for a meal or fuel the car. And one person would pay for everyone because it is faster and more convinient then spliting the bill right away. At the end we would calculate compensations for people who paid. It was cumbersome work. And I thought, hey it would be great to have a program that does this. So I wrote that program
